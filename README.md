# Sakura-Project-Documentation


This is the documentation of my Sakura-Project with its core-component SakuraTree (https://github.com/kitsudaiki/SakuraTree) 

## Prebuild

Prebuild for latest master-version:

https://gitlab.com/kitsudaiki/Sakura-Project-Documentation/-/jobs/701227612/artifacts/browse

**IMPORTANT**: The master-version of the documentation actually differs from the master of the code, because the code has a bit bigger restructure for the multi-node support.

## Build 

Build latex-document:

```
git clone https://github.com/kitsudaiki/Sakura-Project-Documentation.git
cd Sakura-Project-Documentation
make latexpdf 

# pdf-document is generated under ./build/latex/Sakura-Project.pdf
```
